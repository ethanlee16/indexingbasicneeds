# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

    - name: "Food Support"
      description: >
        Food support refers to the provision of food or financial support to purchase
        food in emergency situations or to provide longer-term solutions in areas
        where food resources are limited. A goal of food support is to create food
        security – a situation in which people need not be vulnerable to hunger and
        starvation.

        Food insecurity refers to the limited or uncertain availability of safe and
        nutritionally adequate foods; or limited or uncertain ability to obtain such
        food in a socially acceptable manner. In its most extreme form, known as hunger,
        individuals can experience physiological conditions such as uneasiness and pain.
    - name: "Housing Support"
      description: >
        Housing support refers to assistance to enable individuals secure and maintain
        suitable housing or shelter.

        Homelessness means that a student does not have a stable, reliable, or permanent
        place to live, often residing in a shelter, automobile, motel, a public
        facility, or an abandoned building or outside. Housing insecurity refers
        to a broader set of challenges that could include the inability to pay rent
        or utilities, need to move frequently, or residing in a place where personal
        safety or health is compromised.
    - name: "Economic Support"
      description: >
        Economic support refers financial security of having stable and predictable
        income or other resources to support a standard of living now and in the
        foreseeable future.

        Financial insecurity refers to the inability for students to access financial
        resources to be a successful student, or find the resources to gain financial
        literacy, such as educational materials to understand what resources are available
        and where to receive additional support.
    - name: "Emergency Support"
      description: >
        Emergency support* refers to relief or interventions for students experiencing
        acute emotional, medical, psychological or resource stressors.

        *Related Resource Area: We understand basic needs experiences are not limited
        to economic, food, and housing areas. While these three areas are the focus of
        our Basic Needs Center, our resource index includes areas directly impacted by
        basic needs.
    - name: "Holistic Support"
      description: >
        Holistic support* refers to broad range of services that address the ongoing and
        dynamic needs in all domains of one’s life across personal, social, and
        academic/professional well-being.

        Students experience basic needs challenges beyond economic, food, and housing.
        Often times personal, social, and academic/professional areas are not accessible,
        neglected, and/or cannot be prioritized.
