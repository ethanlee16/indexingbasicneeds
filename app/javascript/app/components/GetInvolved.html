            <h1>Get Involved</h1>
            <p>Our Basic Needs community is made up of students, interns, volunteers, staff, and administrators who
                contribute to our efforts
            </p>

            <h2>Field Study Units</h2>
            <p>The Basic Needs community has exciting projects every year that require passionate and committed interns
                and volunteers to maximize their success. For those interested in the unit-earning internship, the unit
                count determines time requirement:</p>
            <p>
                <c>1 unit = 45 hours <br>
                    2 units = 90 hours
                </c>
            </p>
            <p>If you are interested, please review our application specifics & coordinator descriptions to inform your
                team selection! All interns will also volunteer at the UCB Food Pantry in addition to their allocated
                responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>Student testimonial: <br>
                “Working with the food pantry has been an insightful experience because it not only allowed me to build
                connections on campus but with the community as well. As a funds and resources intern, I learned a lot
                of skills including but not limited to: grant writing, public speaking, marketing, networking, and
                skills that I’ll be able to use even beyond my time with the Food Pantry.”
            </p>

            <h2>Student Coalition</h2>
            <p>The Student Coalition is a space for student leaders working towards basic needs security to come
                together and coordinator, collaborate, support, and strategize with one another. The Coalition unifies
                the student voice (undergraduate and graduate) in basic needs security dialogues and initiatives,
                representing over 15 independent organizations and offices.
            </p>
            <h2>Food Pantry</h2>
            <p>The UC Berkeley Food Pantry is a direct response to the need among the student population for more
                resources to fight food insecurity––the lack of nutritious food.
            </p>

            <p>“Volunteering at the Food Pantry has empowered me to help make a change in the Berkeley community. Being
                a first generation, low-income student, I constantly face economic challenges and the Food Pantry is a
                great resource that helps alleviate student food need. Food insecurity is a serious issue and it is
                critical for our students to have nutritious foods so that they can concentrate on their academics.”
