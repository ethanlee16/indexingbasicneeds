                            “Working with the food pantry has been an insightful experience because it not only allowed
                            me
                            to
                            build
                            connections on campus but with the community as well. As a funds and resources intern, I
                            learned a
                            lot
                            of skills including but not limited to: grant writing, public speaking, marketing,
                            networking,
                            and
                            skills that I’ll be able to use even beyond my time with the Food Pantry.”

                        <p>“Volunteering at the Food Pantry has empowered me to help make a change in the Berkeley
                            community.
                            Being
                            a first generation, low-income student, I constantly face economic challenges and the Food
                            Pantry
                            is a
                            great resource that helps alleviate student food need. Food insecurity is a serious issue
                            and
                            it is
                            critical for our students to have nutritious foods so that they can concentrate on their
                            academics.”
