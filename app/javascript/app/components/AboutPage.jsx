                  Basic Needs Security refers to the food, housing, and economic
                  security of our community. We understand that basic needs have
                  a direct impact on the mental-emotional-physical health,
                  wellness, academic performance, professional development, and
                  holistic success of students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The quality of life of our students has a major impact on
                  their sense of belonging, persistence, graduation, and overall
                  experience. Therefore, we refuse to accept hunger,
                  malnourishment, and homelessness as part of our university.

                  Basic Needs is committed to accomplishing food, housing and
                  economic justice on the UC Berkeley campus through a robust
                  model of prevention, intervention and emergency relief
                  efforts. Our goal is to ensure that UC Berkeley is a Basic
                  Needs Secure campus. Our prevention efforts thus far have
                  included pre-college education, first year student outreach
                  and messaging around Basic Needs, as well as Basic Needs skill
                  development such as NST 20 lecture, and nutrition and cooking
                  demonstration. Emergency interventions include the UC Berkeley
                  Food Pantry which provides emergency food relief. Crisis
                  interventions include the Food Assistance Program which
                  provides eligible students with financial support for food, as
                  well as the Emergency Housing Support program.

                      Food support refers to the provision of food or financial
                      support to purchase food in emergency situations or to
                      provide longer-term solutions in areas where food
                      resources are limited. A goal of food support is to create
                      food security â€“ a situation in which people need not be
                      vulnerable to hunger and starvation.

                      <br />
                      Food insecurity refers to the limited or uncertain
                      availability of safe and nutritionally adequate foods; or
                      limited or uncertain ability to obtain such food in a
                      socially acceptable manner. In its most extreme form,
                      known as hunger, individuals can experience physiological
                      conditions such as uneasiness and pain.

                      abandoned building or outside. Housing insecurity refers
                      to a broader set of challenges that could include the
                      inability to pay rent or utilities, need to move
                      frequently, or residing in a place where personal safety
