                            After some guidance from my EOP counselor, I was connected to the Financial Aid
                            Scholarships and Food Assistance Program. Within one day of emailing them, I was supplied
                            with additional funds to my student account.
                            Without this program, I would have continued to suffer in silence. This program is crucial
                            to students coming from low-income homes and I'm grateful for the assistance I was provided
                            in my time of need.
